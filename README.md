##Requirements of the task
1. Get your API Key as explained within the documentation https://newsapi.org.
2. Use Android Studio or XCode and share the project via email of via Github.
3. Write a few sentences (max. 10) about your approach and send it with your solution.
4. You can use third party libraries with its preference to handle dependencies.
5. Take the opportunity to showcase your coding style and use whatever design pattern
(MVC, MVVM, etc) you would normally have used for this kind of task.

The sample app when run will show you a simple list of all the Bufferoos (Buffer team members!).

## What I could improve in the future

## What was the most difficult part and why

## Why RxJava2 and why not Coroutines

## Why clean architecture and why MVVM with LiveData and ViewModels


1. Interface style, how you implemented the solution visually
2. Code structure, is the solution scalable
3. Code style, is everything well documented
4. Are all the stated requirements implemented
